# CarbonPaperGyroEnhancement
 Calculating the nuc spins gyromagnetic ratio enhancement for the Carbon Paper.

 I am calculating the gyromagnetic ratio enhancement for $^{13}C$ nucleus spin in the spin defects embedded in hexagonal Boron Nitride. I had prepared these samples and we measured them for interesting properties from the perspective of quantum sensing.

 This code is primarily written in Matlab and I will make frequent changes until the paper is accepted for publication.
